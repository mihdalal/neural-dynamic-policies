# pytorch-a2c-ppo-acktr

## Please use hyper parameters from this readme. With other hyper parameters things might not work (it's RL after all)!

This is a PyTorch implementation of
* Advantage Actor Critic (A2C), a synchronous deterministic version of [A3C](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01783v1.pdf)
* Proximal Policy Optimization [PPO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347.pdf)
* Scalable trust-region method for deep reinforcement learning using Kronecker-factored approximation [ACKTR](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05144)
* Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning [GAIL](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03476)

Also see the OpenAI posts: [A2C/ACKTR](https://blog.openai.com/baselines-acktr-a2c/) and [PPO](https://blog.openai.com/openai-baselines-ppo/) for more information.

This implementation is inspired by the OpenAI baselines for [A2C](https://github.com/openai/baselines/tree/master/baselines/a2c), [ACKTR](https://github.com/openai/baselines/tree/master/baselines/acktr) and [PPO](https://github.com/openai/baselines/tree/master/baselines/ppo1). It uses the same hyper parameters and the model since they were well tuned for Atari games.

## Supported (and tested) environments (via [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com))
* [Atari Learning Environment](https://github.com/mgbellemare/Arcade-Learning-Environment)
* [MuJoCo](http://mujoco.org)
* [PyBullet](http://pybullet.org) (including Racecar, Minitaur and Kuka)
* [DeepMind Control Suite](https://github.com/deepmind/dm_control) (via [dm_control2gym](https://github.com/martinseilair/dm_control2gym))

I highly recommend PyBullet as a free open source alternative to MuJoCo for continuous control tasks.

All environments are operated using exactly the same Gym interface. See their documentations for a comprehensive list.

To use the DeepMind Control Suite environments, set the flag `--env-name dm.<domain_name>.<task_name>`, where `domain_name` and `task_name` are the name of a domain (e.g. `hopper`) and a task within that domain (e.g. `stand`) from the DeepMind Control Suite. Refer to their repo and their [tech report](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00690) for a full list of available domains and tasks. Other than setting the task, the API for interacting with the environment is exactly the same as for all the Gym environments thanks to [dm_control2gym](https://github.com/martinseilair/dm_control2gym).


## Contributions

Contributions are very welcome. If you know how to make this code better, please open an issue. If you want to submit a pull request, please open an issue first. Also see a todo list below.

Also I'm searching for volunteers to run all experiments on Atari and MuJoCo (with multiple random seeds).

## Disclaimer

It's extremely difficult to reproduce results for Reinforcement Learning methods. See ["Deep Reinforcement Learning that Matters"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06560) for more information. I tried to reproduce OpenAI results as closely as possible. However, majors differences in performance can be caused even by minor differences in TensorFlow and PyTorch libraries.
